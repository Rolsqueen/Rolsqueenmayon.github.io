<center><b><font face=Tahoma size=12 color=red> Hi! I'm Sittie Rolaiza Mayon <br> 
but you can call me Rolai for short. I am the youngest among us siblings and<br>
maybe the reason to have this kind of attitude. I am a person who is short-tempered<br>
to the point that I don't talk to anyone at certain times and be just a loner. Right now I'm currently<br>
having my trait improved. I am not that bad, I start to have such temper when certain factors trigger<br>
my mood and in fact, I'm really friendly and funny. By the way, this is my Web site and hope you had fun<br>
while visiting it. Have a nice and wonderful day!</font></b></center>
